# Functionality: 
1) Species should die when they hit 0 population

3) Player's species should be able to purchase feats
4) The log feed should record events e.g.:

	-) Species that buy feats
	-) Species going extinct
5) AI: other species should at least somewhat react to changes, or maintain some competition.
