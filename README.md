# Evolution
## Batch commands
Running the commands in the batch folder will watch less and typescript files respectively and update the generated files when the source files are changed.

## Tests
Run unit tests from the command line with npm test

## To do
# Functionality: 
- Player's species should be able to purchase feats
- The log feed should record events e.g.:
	-) Climate changes that change the food multiplier
	-) Species that buy feats
	-) Species going extinct
- Competing species should randomly appear occasionally
- AI: other species should at least somewhat react to changes, or maintain some competition.
- Extra stats should be added as species develops
- Gather rate etc. should work cumulatively, so that things exponentially grow
- temperatures should give a description not a number

# Design:
- Information about the game should be supplied
- Beautify; particularly general text and button appearance
- limit number display lengths
